# Garbage-Image-Classification-using-CNN
This project develops a deep learing-based image classification system to automatically categorize waste items into different types such as paper, metal, plastic, glass, cardboard, and general trash. Using convolutional neural networks trained from scratch, the system aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between various waste categories.
